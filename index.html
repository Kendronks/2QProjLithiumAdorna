                    People usually play osu! to have fun and listen to songs while tapping to the beat, just like any other rhythm game. But there are other reasons, some people play to make beatmaps of their favorite songs,

                    <section class ="text">
                        I cannot really say why you should play osu!, but I can tell you that the decision to play the game is good, you will discover a great community and an incredible game behind it. It lets you free 
                        yourself from the shackles of real life and puts you in a different world, a world where you can be who you want to be, without much consequence. It allows you to create relationships and make friends
