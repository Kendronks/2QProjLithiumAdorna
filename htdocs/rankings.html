            <h3>What is the Ranking system for osu!std?</h3>

            <p>
                osu! uses a ranking system called ppv2, in a basic rundown, it tries to relate your overall skill to a single number, that being your amount of perfomance points.
                You gain <a href="terminology.html#pp">perfomance points(pp)</a> by setting scores on maps(only the best score on each map will be recorded), and your top 100 scores(from different maps) contribute to your
                overall performance points. The specifics on how pp is calculated changes over time, and takes many things into account, so for now, all you have to remember is that you gain
                pp from setting <a href="terminology.html#score">scores</a>, and that each score is weighted based on how high it is in relation to your best score. This means that your 2nd highest score in terms of raw pp 
                is only going to give you 95% of that raw pp value to add to your total, your 3rd gives you 90%, your 4th gives you 85% and so on. This system has been criticized as not
                being representative of a person's skill level, since there are many different types of players, and the system favors some over others. To showcase and improve their skill,
                people go to tournaments to test themselves, and have fun.

            <h3>What are osu! tournaments</h3>
            <p>
                Osu! tournaments are independently organized competitions that feature prizes such as cosmetic items for your profile, merchandise, and in most cases,
                money. They pit players against each other in multiple formats, one of the most popular is the <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/OWC/2021#ruleset">
                osu! world cup format</a>, or <a href="terminology.html#owc">OWC</a> ruleset for short. OWC pits participating countries against each other to win prizes and limited in-game items, the recent
                2021 OWC (Sept 16 - Nov 27, 2021) featured a 5000$ prize pool and limited edition merchandise, and saw the United States win 1st place, with Germany in 2nd and South Korea in 3rd.
                Tournaments usually feature a 1v1-4v4 situation, in which all players pick a map from a set mappool, and simultaneously play the map, the team with the highest
                score wins the round, usually with a total of 7-15 rounds, including <a href="terminology.html#tb">tiebreaker</a>. You can check the <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments">tournaments tab</a> 
                in the osu website for more information on specific tournaments.
