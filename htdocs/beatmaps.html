            <h3>What is a <a href="terminology.html#beatmap">beatmap?</a></h3>
            <p>
                A beatmap is a downloadable file made by a person using the game's beatmap editor. It is a 'mapping' of the beat of a song
                so that players can tap the circles to said beat. All beatmaps are made by people who dedicate their time and creativity to willingly
                create these beatmaps for people to play. These people (Called <a href="terminology.html#mapper">mappers</a>) are integral to the development of the game, and deserve
                every bit of recognition they can get, they play a different game with the same name, and are learning with every new map that they make. 
                As to where you can acquire these beatmaps, you can download them on the beatmaps section of the 
                <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets">osu! website</a>, there are also beatmapsets that compile beatmaps of similar styles to make it easier to 
                find maps to play. All in all, beatmaps and beatmappers are what allow players to set incredible plays, and incredible scores.

                <li>Classifications of maps (according to osu!std <a href="rankings.html">ranking</a> system)</li>
                <li>WIP: The map is specified by the mapper as not done, or work in progress</li>
                <li>Pending: The mapper has checked their map to the best of their ability, and is waiting for community feedback</li>
                <li>Qualified: The beatmap has recieved enough recognition from the community, and it has been nominated by the Beatmap Nominators to be Ranked</li>
                <li>Ranked: The map has been Qualified for at least 7 days, and the beatmap has passed the qualification stage, meaning you can gain perfomance points from the map</li>
                <li>Loved: The map is nominated by the players as a popular map, but the BN's find that it does not necessarily meet the ranking criteria they have</li>
                <li>Graveyard: The map has not been touched by the mapper for at least 4 weeks, and has effectively been abandoned</li>

            <h3>What are <a href="terminology.html#mapper">mappers?</a></h3>
            <p>
                Mappers are the people who make the beatmaps for players to play. They essentially make the 'levels' for the game itself.
                They use the game's beatmap editor to make these beatmaps, and upload them to the <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets">osu! website</a> for Beatmap Nominators(BN's) to test
                and eventually, <a href="rankings.html">rank</a> the beatmap, or map for short. Since there are no hard restrictions on how you can make a beatmap(aside from media resource restrictions 
                and sensitive content restrictions, also anti-troll restrictions),
                different styles form for each map, and ultimately, each mapper develops their own style that's best suited for the songs they like to map, and the players they
                cater to. Here are some of the mapping styles that people commonly use in the community
