				<h1>What is Aim?</h1>
				<section class="text">
					<article>
					<a href="terminology.html#aim">Aim</a> is one of the core mechanics that you need to learn when playing OSU!, It is the ability to move your cursor to each circle while maintaining rhythm with the music. You can visualize aim as drawing, the more you 
					do it, the better you get. As you continue to draw, your hands get faster and more precise with drawing different shapes, it is similar with aim. In this regard, aim is different in OSU! than it is in other games, 
					in games like Valorant or Counter-Strike, you usually have only one target to hit over an uncertain period of time, let's say flicking to an opponent with your mouse. In other games, like minecraft, you are not really
					time-bound by anything with your aim, like when you're breaking a block or placing a block, when attacking, you're usually tracking an opponent with your crosshair, and not really having a stationary target. OSU! 
					incorporates all of these aiming elements with a <a href="terminology.html#rhythm">rhythmic</a> time-window, and stationary and moving targets. Incredible aim only comes with practice and dedication to becoming consistent with your movements, being 
					able to hit any <a href="terminology.html#circle">circle</a> from anywhere on the screen. Below is an example of what jump aim looks like (example recorded by Johan Henrik G. Adorna, recorded osu! with Medal, recording software for gaming)

				<h1>What is Tapping?</h1>
				<section class="text2">
					<article>
					<a href="terminology.html#tapping">Tapping</a> is another of the core mechanics that you need to learn when playing OSU!, it is the ability to tap your non-domainant hand's fingers to the beat of the song that you are playing, knowing
					when to hold and when to just tap, all while using your domainant hand to aim the circles that you need to click. OSU! initially was built so that you could play with only the mouse, using the left 
					and right mouse button to tap to the beat while aiming. But since people started using tablets, and using one hand to play became more and more difficult with the progression of map <a href="terminology.html#difficulty">difficulty</a>, people
					started using their keyboards and started tapping instead of clicking, hence the mechanic being called tapping. This is what makes OSU! a rhythm game by definition, you tap circles to the beat. The progression
					of this skill is similar to aim, the more you play, and the more you repeat certain <a href="terminology.html#patterns">patterns</a>, the easier it is to tap to the beat, similar to playing an instrument. But people can notice when your tapping is consistent and fast, what differentiates a new player from a refined one is that their tapping is not 
					only more consistent, it is also faster. This is where the concept of <a href="terminology.html#speed">speed</a> comes in, the ability to consistently tap to a beat at an absurdly fast rate, or a high bpm. There are other concepts to tappping, speed
					is only the easiest of them to grasp, you will find these intricacies of tapping when you delve deeper into the game, but for now that is all you need. Below is an example of one type of tapping, <a href="terminology.html#streams">streams</a>. Observe the right
					side of the screen when watching, since you will see my keypresses with the upper 2 numbers (example recorded by Johan Henrik G. Adorna, recorded osu! with Medal, recording software for gaming)
